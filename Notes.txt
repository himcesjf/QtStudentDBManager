Notes:
##PostgreSQL

This is user::password - myuser::myuser
Database name - mydb

Make sure in your postgresql.conf you enable the listen address and port
sudo nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

And, in your pg_hga.conf make sure all the lines that say "ident" are changed to "md5"
sudo nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

Then restart it
sudo systemctl reload postgresql
